Create a *class conditional density plot* like the one below (which was created using `sns.distplot`), comparing the distribution of a feature among all spam emails to the distribution of the same feature among all ham emails. **You may use the Fraction of Uppercase Letters or create your own feature.**\n",

    "Now we have matrices we can give to scikit-learn! Using the [`LogisticRegression`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) classifier, train a logistic regression model using `Phi_train` and `Y_train`. Then, output the accuracy of the model (on the training data) in the cell below. You should get an accuracy of around 0.75."

In future parts of this analysis, it will be safer to hold out some of our data for model validation and comparison.\n",

    "- False negative (FN): a spam email gets mislabelled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\n",

    "e. This classifier could be performing poorly because our features are weak. We are only checking occurences of these specific words, not even how many times they occur (emails that say \"money\" or transaction\" 5 times versus 1 time are more likely to be spam, in my hypothesis). Also, we are predicting on very few words overall.  This doesn't even address grammatical issues, occurrence of links, or capital letters. \n",

    "f. I would still rather use the logistic regressor since there is a slightly higher accuracy, and at least there is some sort of logic / feature behind the model, rather than predicting everything as 0. Also, I can actually add features and improve the model myself, which I plan to do. "

    "With this in mind, it is now your task to make the spam filter more accurate. In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the evaluation set. To see your accuracy on the evaluation set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `evaluation` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",

    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use whatever method you prefer in order to create features. However, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models and their regularized forms**. This means no random forest, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc.\n",

There is also a correlation between having a lot of upper case letters and being identified as a spam email. \n",

    "# Question 9 (Making a Precision-Recall Curve)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle)."
